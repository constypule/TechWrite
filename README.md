Technical Writing
Writing a README file is a standard practice in software and open source projects. It is a plain text document that provides an introduction to a project and gives users and contributors information on how to use the project and contribute to it. Here is a typical structure and syntax for a README file.

### Structure

1. **Project Title**: At the very top, bold and centered.
2. **Logo (Optional)**: If your project has a logo, you can include it here.
3. **Table of Contents** (Optional): For long READMEs, a brief overview of sections can improve readability.
4. **Overview**: A brief description of what the project is about.
5. **Installation**: Instructions on how to install the project.
6. **Usage**: How to use the project, including examples if applicable.
7. **Features**: Highlight the key features of your project.
8. **Dependencies**: Any libraries or software that the project relies on.
9. **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing to the project, including any coding standards to follow.
10. **License**: The license under which the project is distributed.
11. **Contact**: Who to reach out to for questions or contributions.
12. **Acknowledgements (Optional)**: Any individuals or organizations that have contributed to the project.

### Syntax

- **Markdown**: README files are typically written in Markdown, a simple markup language that allows you to format text.

  - **Headers** are created using one to six hash symbols (#). Example: `# Project Title` for a large heading.
  - **Bold** text is created using double asterisks or underscores. Example: `**bold text**` or `_bold text_`.
  - **Italic** text is created using single asterisks or underscores. Example: `*italic text*` or `_italic text_`.
  - **Bullet points** are created using `-`, `*`, or `+`. Example: `- Bullet point`.
  - **Numbered lists** are created using numbers followed by periods. Example: `1. First item`.
  - **Code snippets** are indicated using backticks for inline code (`inline code`) or triple backticks for block code:
    ```python
    def hello():
        print("Hello, World!")
    ```
  - **Links** can be added using square brackets and parentheses. Example: `[link text](https://www.example.com)`.

- **File Extension**: README files typically have a `.md` extension, indicating that they are a Markdown document. The filename is usually just `README`, but it can also be `README.md` to explicitly specify the Markdown extension.

### Example

```markdown
# Project Name

Welcome to Project Name!
